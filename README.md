## AutoElevate by CyberFOX Roadmap

This is the public roadmap for AutoElevate by CyberFOX's apps & services. Welcome!

[See the roadmap »](https://github.com/orgs/AutoElevate/projects/1)

NOTE: Because roadmap items can change at any time, make your purchasing decisions based on currently available technology. 

## Introduction

AutoElevate would like to share more about what we're researching and working on to make it easier to view, and share feedback on upcoming improvements to our apps & services.

This roadmap replaces the site found here: [AE Community Feature Requests »](https://support.autoelevate.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/115000367152-Feature-Requests)

All items found on that site will be migrated here and given a "Proposed" tag. **We will enable the ability to add new requests here soon.**

## FAQs

**Q: What do the roadmap categories mean?**

- _Researching/Under Consideration_ - We're looking into this idea, often in the form of requirements gathering or thinking through potential designs. This is a great time to show support or dissent for various features.
- _Next_ - These are the next items to be worked on. Refinement & scope changes are possible. Items may be modified, added, or removed.
- _In Progress_ - Actively being worked on but the details are often still flexible.
- _Shipped_ - Done & delivered as generally available, unless otherwise noted.

**Q: Why did you build this?**

A: We wanted to share more about what we're working on, but especially want to hear from customers about novel use cases, challenges, or any other kind of feedback. Put simply, we wanted to talk more, and more directly, to all of you about what we're working on and what we _should_ be working on next.

**Q: Why are there no dates on your roadmap?**

A: Our top priority is a focus on security, stability, and availability of our services, which means we need to remain flexible on some aspects of feature development and delivery timelines to ensure we can keep that level of trust in place without compromise. We're strongly committed to being transparent in this project, but we need to note that plans can and do change. As such items on the roadmap are not a firm guarantee that a feature will be released.

**Q: Is everything on the roadmap?**

A: The majority of our development work for our projects are included on this roadmap. Smaller incremental improvements/changes may be scheduled more opportunistically and not represented on this roadmap, depending on utility. Of course, this doesn't preclude the occasional project that we may launch without notice in order to preserve the element of surprise.

**Q: How can I request a feature be added to the roadmap?**

A: We will soon give you the ability to open your own issues on this repository. Community submitted issues will be tagged "Proposed" and we'll review them regularly.
